What is Twenty
Twenty is an open-source CRM that gives you the building blocks to create exactly what your business needs.

​
Vision
Creating a good CRM is hard because it’s a balancing act. For each business, the requirements seem straightforward, yet everyone’s needs are distinct. The result is a CRM that’s either too basic, or one that’s attempting to be a jack-of-all-trades but ending up as a master of none.
At first, Twenty looks like most CRMs you already know: you can track deals, organize contacts, manage tasks and notes. But what sets it apart is our approach to extensibility. We are building an open platform that provides the building blocks for you to solve your unique business problems.
We prioritize universal principles and common patterns over feature lists. We don’t try to have all the answers and instead empower users to find what works best for them. Open-source is the bedrock of our approach, ensuring that Twenty evolves with its community, for its community.
