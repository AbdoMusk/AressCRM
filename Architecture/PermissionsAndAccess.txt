Permissions & Access
Manage roles, permissions, and access control in your workspace.

Permissions & Access
Twenty’s permission system lets you control who can access and modify data in your workspace. Create roles, assign permissions, and configure SSO for secure access.
​
What’s in this section

FAQ
Common questions about roles, permissions, and SSO.
​
Key features
Role-based access: Create custom roles with specific permissions
Object permissions: Control who can view, edit, or delete records
Field permissions: Restrict access to sensitive fields
Settings permissions: Control access to workspace configuration
SSO integration: Configure single sign-on for enterprise security (Organization plan)

Permissions
Control access to objects, fields, and settings with role-based permissions.

Twenty’s permission system allows you to control access to three main areas:
Objects and Fields: Control who can view, edit, or delete records and individual fields
Settings: Manage access to workspace configuration and administrative functions
Actions: Control general workspace actions like importing data or sending emails
​
Create a Role
To create a new role:
Go to Settings → Roles
Under All Roles, click on + Create Role
Enter a role name
In the default Permissions tab, configure permissions
Click Save to finish
​
Delete a Role
To delete a role:
Go to Settings → Roles
Click on the role you want to remove
Open the Settings tab, then click Delete Role
Click Confirm in the modal
If a role is deleted, any workspace member assigned to it will be automatically reassigned to the default role. All except the Admin role can be deleted. There must always be at least one member assigned to the Admin role.
​
Assign Roles to Members
​
View Current Assignments
Go to Settings → Roles
See all roles and how many members are assigned to each
View which members have which roles
​
Assign a Role to a Member
Go to Settings → Roles
Click on the role you want to assign
Open the Assignment tab
Click + Assign to member
Select the workspace member from the list
Confirm the assignment
​
Set Default Role
Go to Settings → Roles
In the Options section, find Default Role
Select which role new members should automatically receive
New workspace members will be assigned this role when they join
You can only assign roles to existing workspace members. To invite new members, use Member Management.
​
Customize Permissions
Permissions determine what each role can access or modify within your workspace, including workspace objects records, settings, and actions.
​
Object Permissions
The Objects section controls what this role can do with records across your workspace.
​
Set Default Permissions (All Objects)
First, configure the baseline permissions that apply to all objects by default:
Permission	Description
See Records on All Objects	View records in lists and detail pages
Edit Records on All Objects	Modify existing records
Delete Records on All Objects	Soft-delete records (can be restored)
Destroy Records on All Objects	Permanently delete records
Select or unselect based on what should be the default behavior for this role.
Example — Intern role: An intern should be able to see all objects but not edit them by default. Enable “See Records on All Objects” but leave “Edit Records on All Objects” unchecked.
​
Add Object-Level Exceptions
After setting defaults, use the Object-Level sub-section to add rules that override the defaults for specific objects.
Click + Add rule and select an object to create an exception.
Example rules for an Intern role:
Rule	Effect
Opportunities → disable “See Records”	Intern cannot see the Opportunities object at all
People → enable “Edit Records”	Intern can edit People records (but not other objects)
​
Field Permissions
Within each object-level rule, you can go further and configure field-level permissions to control access to specific fields.
Permission	Description
See Field	View the field value
Edit Field	Modify the field value
No Access	Field is completely hidden
Example — Restrict sensitive fields:
For the Intern role with People edit access, you might want to restrict certain fields:
People → Email → See Field only (cannot edit)
People → Address → No Access (completely hidden)
This allows the intern to edit most People fields while protecting sensitive information.
​
How Permission Inheritance Works
Permissions cascade from general to specific:
All Objects → sets the baseline for all objects
Object-Level rules → override the baseline for specific objects
Field-Level rules → override the object setting for specific fields
More specific settings always take precedence.
​
Managing Permission Overrides
To override inherited permissions:
Click X to remove the inherited rule
Select the specific permissions you want
Click the orange Undo icon (circular arrow) to revert changes
When done, click Finish, then Save once redirected to the role page.
​
Workspace Settings Permissions
Control access to workspace settings in two ways:
Toggle Settings All Access to grant full access
Or enable specific permissions (e.g., API key generation, workspace preferences, role assignment, data model configuration, security settings, and workflow management)
Current limitation: Access to workflow management is currently required to manually trigger workflows. This behavior may change in future releases.
​
Workspace Action Permissions
Control access to general workspace actions:
Toggle Application All Access to grant full permissions
Or enable individual actions such as Send Email, Import CSV, and Export CSV
​
Assigning Roles to API Keys and AI Agents
Beyond workspace members, roles can also be assigned to API Keys and AI Agents. This is particularly helpful for teams who want to control exactly “who” can do what in their workspace—including automated processes and integrations.
​
Why Assign Roles to API Keys and AI Agents?
Security: Limit what automated processes can access or modify
Compliance: Ensure integrations only touch the data they need
Control: Prevent accidental data changes from misconfigured automations
Auditability: Track which actions were performed by which integration or agent
​
Assign a Role to an API Key
Go to Settings → Roles
Click on the role you want to assign
Open the Assignment tab
Under API Keys, click + Assign to API key
Select the API key from the list
Confirm the assignment
The API key will now inherit all permissions defined by that role. Any API calls made with this key will be restricted accordingly.
API keys without an assigned role use default permissions. For tighter security, always assign a specific role to production API keys.
​
Assign a Role to an AI Agent
Go to Settings → Roles
Click on the role you want to assign
Open the Assignment tab
Under AI Agents, click + Assign to AI agent
Select the AI agent from the list
Confirm the assignment
The AI agent will only be able to access data and perform actions allowed by its assigned role.
For AI agents running within workflows, this ensures the agent cannot access or modify data outside its intended scope—even if the workflow has broader permissions.
