​
Key Concepts
​
Dashboards
A dashboard is a collection of tabs that display your CRM data at a glance. You can create multiple dashboards for different purposes:
Sales performance
Team activity
Pipeline health
Custom metrics
​
Tabs
Tabs allow you to organize your dashboard into sections. Each tab contains one or more widgets.
​
Widgets
Widgets are individual visualizations that display specific data. Types include:
Bar charts
Pie charts
Line charts
Aggregate charts
iFrames
Rich text
Current limitations:
Exporting dashboards and sharing with external users (non-Twenty users) are not available at the moment.
Gauge charts and tables are not yet available.

​
Best Practices
Logical flow: Arrange from overview to detail
Visual hierarchy: Larger charts for key metrics
Consistent styling: Use matching colors and fonts
​
Visibility & Access
​
Dashboard Visibility
Dashboards are visible to everyone who has access to your Twenty workspace. There is no private dashboard option at the moment.
​
Favorites
You can add dashboards to your favorites for quick access. This is a personal setting—your favorites are not visible to other users.
To add a dashboard to favorites, open the dashboard and click the star icon.
​
Timezone Behavior
Dashboards currently display data based on the timezone of the user viewing them. This means the same dashboard may show different metrics for team members in different regions (e.g., APAC vs. US).
Coming soon: We will add the ability to set a specific timezone for a dashboard, so all users see consistent data regardless of their location.
Coming soon: Dashboard-level filters will allow you to apply filters across all widgets at once, making it faster to explore your data.

​
Available Widgets
Twenty provides various widget types to visualize your CRM data.
​
Bar Charts
Display data as horizontal or vertical bars.
Bar chart

Comparing values across categories
Showing rankings
Tracking metrics by time period
Example uses:
Deals by stage
Revenue by sales rep
Contacts added per month
Display limits: Bar charts can show a maximum of 100 bars, and 50 groups per bar when using Group By. If you see the warning “Undisplayed data: max X bars per chart”, add filters to narrow down your data or change the grouping (e.g., group by week instead of days).
​
Pie Charts
Show proportions of a whole.
Pie chart
Best for:
Showing composition or distribution
Comparing parts to whole
Highlighting major segments
Example uses:
Deal distribution by source

Quick status checks
Example uses:
Total pipeline value
Number of open opportunities
Conversion rate
Advanced options:
Ratio: For Select fields, calculate ratios between values. Go to Data on display → select your field → enable the Ratio option.
Prefix & Suffix: Add custom text before or after the number (e.g., ”$” prefix or ”%” suffix) for better readability.
​
iFrames
Embed external tools and content directly in your dashboard.

​
Duplicating Widgets
Click on the widget
Open Options
Click Duplicate widget

Chart Settings
Configure your charts to display data exactly how you need it.

​
Accessing Chart Settings
Click the Edit button in the top-right corner of your dashboard
Edit mode
The dashboard enters edit mode
Click on any widget to select it
The settings panel opens on the right
Settings are organized into sections:
Data: What data to pull and how to filter it
X axis: How to group and sort categories (bar/line charts)
Y axis: What to measure and how to display it (bar/line charts)
Style: Colors, labels, and visual options
Some settings only appear when other settings are configured. For example, Date granularity only appears when you select a date field.
​
Data Settings
​
Source 
Choose which object to pull data from.
Click Source
Select an object (Opportunities, People, Companies, etc.)
All your standard and custom objects are available. Changing the source resets other settings since field options depend on the selected object.
Source
​
Filter 
Limit which records are included in the chart.
Click Filter
The filter builder opens
Click + Add filter
Select a field, condition, and value
Add more filters as needed
Filters work the same as in table views. Use them to focus on specific segments of your data.
Example: Filter opportunities where Stage equals “Won” to show only closed deals.
Filter
For date fields, try Is relative to create dynamic filters like “Past 7 days” or “This month” that automatically update.
Advanced filters are supported—add multiple filter rules and combine them with And or Or logic.
​
X Axis Settings
These settings control the horizontal axis of bar and line charts—typically how your data is grouped into categories.
​
Data on display 
Select the field to group your data by. This determines the categories shown on the X axis.
Example: Select “Stage” to see data grouped by pipeline stage, or “Created date” to see data over time.
Data on display
​
Date granularity 
When grouping by a date field, choose the time period for grouping.
Option	Groups data by	Example output
Day	Each calendar day	Jan 1, Jan 2, Jan 3…
Week	Calendar weeks	Week 1, Week 2, Week 3…
Month	Calendar months	January, February, March…
Quarter	Fiscal quarters	Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4
Year	Calendar years	2023, 2024, 2025
Day of week	Weekday (aggregated)	Monday, Tuesday… (all Mondays combined)
Month of year	Month (aggregated)	January, February… (all Januaries combined)
Quarter of year	Quarter (aggregated)	Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 (all Q1s combined)
The “of week/year” options aggregate across all time. Use Day of week to see which weekday typically gets the most deals. Use Month to see trends month by month.
​
Sort by 
Control the order of categories on the X axis.
Position – Uses the order defined in your Select field settings
Alphabetical – A to Z (or chronological for dates)
By value – Ordered by the metric (highest or lowest first)
Manual – Drag to set your own order
Sort by
Tip: For pipeline stages, use Position to show stages in your sales process order (Lead → Qualified → Proposal → Won).
The options shown depend on your field type. Select fields have all options; date and text fields show fewer.
With Manual sorting, drag categories to create a custom order—perfect for highlighting specific segments or telling a story with your data.
​
Omit zero values 
Hide categories that have zero or no data.
On: Categories with no records are hidden
Off: All categories are shown, even if empty
Use this to clean up charts with sparse data.
​
Y Axis Settings
These settings control what you’re measuring and how it’s displayed.
​
Data on display 
Select the field and operation to calculate your metric.
Counts – Count all, Count empty, Count not empty, Count unique values
Math – Sum, Average, Min, Max (number fields)
Percentages – Percent empty, Percent not empty
Boolean fields add Count true/false. Aggregate charts with date fields show Earliest/Latest.
Example: Select “Amount” with Sum to see total deal value per category, or Count all to see number of deals.
Data on display
The options shown depend on your field and chart type. If you don’t see an expected operation, check your field type.
​
Ratio
For Select, Multi-select, or Boolean fields, you can calculate the percentage of a specific value.
Select a Select, Multi-select, or Boolean field
Enable Ratio
Choose the option to measure
Example: Show “Won” deals as a percentage of all opportunities. If you have 10 Won out of 50 total, the chart shows 20%.
​
Group by 
Add a second dimension to create multiple series (multiple bars or lines).
Set your X axis field first
Click Group by
Select a second field
Example: Group deals by Stage (X axis) AND by Owner (Group by) to see each person’s pipeline breakdown side by side.
Group by
When Group by is set, you’ll see multiple colors in your chart and a legend appears.
​
Date granularity 
When Group by is a date field, choose the time period (same options as X axis).
​
Sort by 
When Group by is set, control the order of grouped series (e.g., which owner’s bar appears first within each category).
Same options as X axis sorting—Position, Alphabetical, and Manual—except value-based sorting is not available for secondary grouping.
​
Cumulative 
Show running totals instead of individual values.
Off: Each bar/point shows its own value
On: Each bar/point shows the sum of all previous values plus its own
Example: January = 10, February = 15
Cumulative off: Shows 10 and 15
Cumulative on: Shows 10 and 25 (10 + 15)
Use cumulative to track progress toward a goal over time.
Cumulative
​
Min range / Max range 
Set fixed minimum and maximum values for the Y axis.
Leave blank for automatic scaling
Enter a number to fix the boundary
When to use:
Set Min to 0 for accurate visual comparisons
Set both for consistent scales across multiple charts
Focus on a specific value range by setting both
​
Style Settings
​
Colors 
Set the color scheme for your chart. Choose from a variety of color palettes.
When grouping by a Select field, the chart automatically uses the colors defined for each option in your field settings.
​
Axis name 
Choose which axis labels to show: None, X axis, Y axis, or Both (bar and line charts only).
​
Stacked bars / Stacked lines 
When Group by is set, choose how multiple series are displayed.
Off (Grouped): Series appear side by side. Use when comparing exact values between groups.
On (Stacked): Series stack on top of each other. Use when showing composition—how parts make up a whole.
Example: Deals by stage, grouped by owner
Grouped: See each owner’s exact numbers side by side
Stacked: See total deals per stage, with each owner’s contribution stacked
​
Data labels 
Show values directly on chart elements (bars, points, slices).
On: Values appear on the chart
Off: No values shown (cleaner look)
​
Legend 
Show or hide the legend (only appears when Group by is set).
On: Legend shows what each color represents
Off: No legend displayed
Hover over a legend item to highlight that group. Click to temporarily hide it from the chart.
​
Chart-Specific Notes
​
Pie charts
 Each slice represents – Define how slices are grouped
 Hide empty category – Remove zero-value slices
 Show value in center – Display the aggregate value (sum, average, count, etc.)
​
Aggregate charts
 Prefix – Add text before the number (e.g., $)
 Suffix – Add text after the number (e.g., %)
