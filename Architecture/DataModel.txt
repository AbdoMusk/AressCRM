Data Model
Learn what a data model is and how to design one that fits your business.

Data Model
​
What is a Data Model?
A data model is the structure that defines how information is organized in your CRM. Think of it as the blueprint of your customer data — you design it once, then fill it with your actual data.
​
Key Concepts
​
Objects
Objects are the main categories of data in your CRM. Each object represents a type of thing you want to track.
Twenty comes with standard objects:
People — individuals (contacts, leads, partners)
Companies — organizations
Opportunities — deals or sales
Notes — attached notes on records
Tasks — to-dos linked to records
You can also create custom objects for anything specific to your business (e.g., Projects, Subscriptions, Events).
​
Fields
Fields are the properties or attributes that describe each object. They store the actual information.
For example, the People object has fields like:
Name
Email
Phone
Job Title
Company (a relation to the Companies object)
Fields have different types: text, number, date, select, multi-select, relation, and more. You can add custom fields to any object.
​
Records
Records are the individual entries within an object — the actual data you create and manage.
For example:
“John Smith” is a record in the People object
“Acme Corp” is a record in the Companies object
An analogy:
Data Model Concept	Real-World Analogy
Objects	Sections in a book (the categories)
Fields	Columns in a spreadsheet (the properties)
Records	Rows in a spreadsheet (the actual entries)
You design the data model (objects + fields) once, then create many records within that structure.
​
Why Customize Your Data Model?
Every business works differently. Customizing your data model means you can shape Twenty around your processes instead of forcing yours into a rigid system.
Twenty offers full flexibility:
Create as many custom objects as you need
Add unlimited custom fields
The price doesn’t change based on customization
​
Tips to Design Your Data Model
​
1. Start with Your Core Objects
Identify the main concepts you work with. Twenty already provides:
People — your contacts
Companies — your accounts
Opportunities — your deals
Think about what else you might need:
Stripe would need a Subscriptions object
Airbnb would need a Trips object
An accelerator would need a Batches object
​
2. Use Fields for Variations, Not New Objects
If something is just a characteristic of an existing object, make it a field.
Use fields for:
Categories and labels (e.g., Industry for Companies)
Status values (e.g., Stage for Opportunities)
Attributes and properties
​
3. Create an Object When It Stands on Its Own
If the concept has its own lifecycle, properties, or relationships, it deserves an object.
Create an object for:
Projects — have deadlines, owners, and tasks
Subscriptions — connect companies, products, and invoices
Events — involve attendees and follow-up actions
These go beyond a single field because they carry their own data and relationships.
​
4. Create an Object When Records Are Open-Ended
If something can be linked multiple times and you don’t know how many, use an object.
Bad approach: Creating fields like Product 1, Product 2, Product 3…
Good approach: Create a Products object and relate it to records. This supports one, two, or a hundred products without changing your model.
​
5. Keep It Simple First
Start with fields. Move to new objects only when you feel the limits:
Too many fields on one object
Repeated records that should be separate
Relationships that don’t fit neatly
​
Special Note on People, Companies, and Opportunities
Email and calendar sync only works with People, Companies, and Opportunities.
These are the only objects where you can access synchronized emails and meetings from your mailbox/calendar. We recommend using them as much as possible.
Best practices:
If you need categories of People, use fields (not new objects)
Example: Use a Person Type field with values “Prospect” and “Partner” instead of creating separate objects
Create different views to filter: one showing partners, another showing prospects
It’s okay to have fields that don’t apply to every record. For example, a Referral Link field on People that only applies when Person Type = Partner. Hide this field from views where it’s not relevant.
​
Questions to Guide Your Choice
Ask yourself:
Is this just a property of something I already have, or does it need its own properties?
Will I ever need to track multiple of these per record, without knowing how many?
Does this concept connect to several different objects, not just one?
Will it have its own lifecycle (stages, start/end dates)?
If the answer is “yes” to one or more, it’s probably time for a new object.
​
Accessing Your Data Model
Go to Settings in the left sidebar
Click Data Model
View all your objects (standard and custom)
Click any object to see and edit its fields
Don’t see Data Model in Settings?
Access to the data model is usually restricted to administrators. Contact your workspace admin if you need access.

Objects
Learn about standard and custom objects in Twenty.

​
Standard Objects
Standard objects are predefined entities in your workspace to help you get started. They’re part of a shared data model accessible to all users of Twenty. You can use them as-is, customize them or deactivate them.

​
People
The People object stores your contacts. It includes contact details and interaction history, so you can see all your customer interactions in one place.
​
Company
The Companies object stores your business accounts. It includes details like industry, size and location. Companies connect to both People and Opportunities objects.
​
Opportunities
The Opportunities object stores deal-related data. It tracks the progression of potential sales, from prospecting to closure, recording stages, deal sizes, associated account, and expected close date. You can view your sales pipeline in a kanban layout.
​
Notes
The Notes object stores free-form notes that can be attached to People, Companies, Opportunities, and other records. Use notes to capture meeting summaries, important details, or any contextual information.
​
Tasks
The Tasks object stores to-dos and action items. Tasks can be linked to People, Companies, Opportunities, and other records. Track due dates, assignees, and completion status to stay on top of your follow-ups.
​
Custom Objects
Custom objects let you store information that’s unique to your organization and that standard objects can’t handle. For example, if you’re SpaceX, you may want to create a custom object for Rockets and Launches.

​
Creating a New Custom Object
To create a new custom object:
Go to Settings in the sidebar on the left.
Under Workspace, go to Data model. Here you’ll be able to see an overview of all your existing Standard and Custom objects (both active and disabled).

Click on + New object at the top. Enter the name (both singular and plural), choose an icon, and add a description for your custom object and hit Save (at the top right). Using Listing as an example of custom object, the singular would be “listing” and the plural would be “listings” along with a description like “Listings that hosts created to showcase their property.”
Your custom object is now created and will appear in your sidebar. You can start adding records to it right away.
​
Managing Objects
​
Deactivating Objects
If you don’t need a standard or custom object:
Go to Settings → Data Model
Find the object you want to deactivate
Click the toggle to deactivate it
The object will be hidden from your workspace but data is preserved
​
Reactivating Objects
To bring back a deactivated object:
Go to Settings → Data Model
Look for deactivated objects (they’ll be grayed out)
Click the toggle to reactivate it
The object and all its data will be restored
​
Best Practices
​
When to Create Custom Objects
Unique business entities: Things specific to your industry or process
Complex relationships: When you need to track connections between multiple entities
Scalable data: When you might have many instances of something
​
When to Use Fields Instead
Simple attributes: Properties that describe existing objects
Categories or labels: Ways to classify existing records
Single values: Information that doesn’t need its own lifecycle
​
Object Naming
Use clear, descriptive names: Make it obvious what the object represents
Follow conventions: Use singular for the object name, plural for the collection
Consider your team: Choose names everyone will understand

Fields
Understand the role of fields and how to manage them.

​
About Fields
Fields are like columns in a spreadsheet. They store different types of data like text, numbers, or dates. Fields can be standard (built-in) or custom (the ones you create).
​
Standard Fields
Standard fields come built-in with Twenty to handle common business needs.
For example, First Name and Last Name are standard fields in the People object. They store text data for individual names.
You cannot delete standard fields, but you can deactivate them if you don’t need them.
You can also customize the options of the standard SELECT type fields, for example the options for the Stage on Opportunities.

​
Custom Fields
Custom fields can be added to any object. You can store text, numbers, dates, dropdown selections, and more. Use custom fields to track information that’s specific to your business.
For instance, a custom field for SpaceX could be Rocket Active Status, indicating if a rocket is operational.

​
Field Types
Twenty supports various field types:
Type	Description	Example
Address	Structured address with street, city, state, country, postal code	Office Address
Array	List of text values	Tags
Boolean	True/false checkbox	Is Active
Currency	Monetary value with currency code	Deal Amount (USD)
Date	Date values	Close Date
Date & Time	Date with time	Meeting Time
Domain	Website domain (used for Companies)	acme.com
Email	Email addresses (with primary + additional)	Contact Email
JSON	Structured JSON data	Custom metadata
Links	URLs with labels (primary + secondary)	Website, LinkedIn
Long Text	Multi-line text	Description, Notes
Multi-Select	Multiple choices from a predefined list	Tags, Categories
Number	Numeric values (integers or decimals)	Quantity, Score
Phone	Phone numbers with country code	Work Phone
Rating	Star rating (1-5)	Priority, Score
Relation	Links to records in other objects	Company → People
Select	Single choice from a predefined list	Stage, Status
Text	Single line of text	Name, Title
​
Create a Custom Field
To add a custom field to any object, follow these steps:
Go to Settings in the left sidebar.
Go to Data Model, then select the object you wish to customize.
Proceed by clicking on Add Field.
Choose a field name and type that suits your requirements. Consider adding a field description for better understanding.
Your newly created field is now available within the application’s fields. To display it on a specific view, click on the options menu, then select Fields.

Quick way: Click the + button at the top right of any object table, then select Customize fields. This takes you directly to the Data Model settings.

​
Deactivate a Field
You can deactivate a field to hide it from the app without losing your data. Think of it as hiding the field rather than deleting it.
Here’s how you can do it:
Find the field you want to deactivate in your object settings.
Click the three dots ⋮ next to the field to open the menu.
Select Deactivate from the dropdown.

What happens when you deactivate a field?
In the app: The field disappears and you can’t add new values to it.
Existing relationships: If it’s a relation field, existing connections stay but you can’t create new ones.
API access: You can still access the field and its data through the API.
You can reactivate Standard and Custom Fields or have the option to permanently delete them.
​
Make Fields Unique
Make a field unique to ensure distinct records cannot have the same value. For example, email addresses are unique for each person.
If you get an error when setting uniqueness, check for duplicate values in your data (including deleted records).
​
Field Configuration Best Practices
​
Naming Conventions and Limitations
Singular and plural named must be distinct: Our GraphQL API needs distinct names for mutations
Protected field names: some names are reserved for system usage (e.g., Type, Application)
​
Currency and Phone Fields
Default currency: can be configured via the data model
Default country codes: can be configured for phone fields via the data model
​
Select Fields
A default option can be selected for each Select field
​
Record Text Fields
Each object has one main display field: This field appears in the leftmost column and represents the record when linked to other objects. It must be a text field. For example, People uses Name as the main field, so when you link a person to a company, you’ll see their name in the company’s view.

Relation Fields
Connect records across different objects using relation fields.

​
Types of Relations
​
One-to-Many
One record in Object A can be linked to many records in Object B.
Example: One Company can have many People (employees).
​
Many-to-One
Many records in Object A can be linked to one record in Object B.
Example: Many People can belong to one Company.
​
Relations to Multiple Object Types
Some objects can link to multiple object types on one side of the relation.
Example: A Note can be attached to one Person AND one Company AND one Opportunity simultaneously. The Note is on the “many” side, connecting to multiple “one” sides.

Similarly, a Project (on the “one” side) could receive links from multiple People, multiple Companies, and multiple Notes.

Import/Export limitation: Relations pointing to multiple object types are not yet supported for CSV import/export. This is on our roadmap.
​
Many-to-Many
Many records in Object A can be linked to many records in Object B.
Example: Many People can be linked to many Projects, and vice versa.
Many-to-many relations use a junction object pattern: an intermediate object that connects both sides. With the junction relation feature, Twenty displays the final linked records directly, hiding the intermediate object from the UI.

Lab Feature: Junction relations must be enabled at Settings → Updates → Lab before use.
See How to Create Many-to-Many Relations for a complete step-by-step guide.
​
Creating a Relation Field
Go to Settings → Data Model
Select the object where you want to add the relation
Click + Add Field
Select Relation as the field type
Choose the target object(s) to relate to
Configure the relation settings:
Field name on source object: The name of the relation field on the object you’re editing
Field name on destination object: The name of the relation field that will appear on the target object
Relation type (one-to-many, many-to-one)
Click Save
​
Standard Relations
Twenty comes with pre-built relations between standard objects:
From Object	To Object	Relation Type
People	Companies	Many-to-One
Opportunities	Companies	Many-to-One
Opportunities	People	Many-to-One
​
Best Practices
​
Planning Relations
Map your data model: Plan relations before creating them
Consider direction: Think about which object “owns” the relationship
Avoid circular dependencies: Keep your data model clean
​
Naming Relations
Use clear names: Make it obvious what the relation represents
Be consistent: Use similar naming patterns across relations
Consider both sides: Name both sides of the relation appropriately
​
Performance
Don’t over-relate: Too many relations can slow down your workspace
​
Limitations
Deleting relations removes the link but not the related records
Circular relations should be avoided for data integrity
